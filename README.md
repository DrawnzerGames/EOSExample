# EOSExample
The working example of EOS from Epic's implementation.

Set Keys for the PROJECT.
1. Go to OnlineSubsystemEOS.cpp.
2. Navigate to this function FOnlineSubsystemEOS::Init()
3. Set all the keys as variable names are very explianatory.

Working Platform
1. Windows.
2. SDK Loads and interface is created fine on Android, but the same code gives EOS_UnexpectedError.

Tested Interface
1. AuthInterface.

This is only POC for my other main project, I m making it open as it may help others.

NOTE
You don't need to copy any DLLs or Linux or Android Binaries. All the binaries are already included.
